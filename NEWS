Changes in Version 0.6-5 (under development)

  o coef<-() method now has a 'drop' argument, allowing free parameters
    to be easily updated inside an optimisation / simulation loop.

  o fixed the case where hydromad() failed if 'Q' was not given in DATA.

Changes in Version 0.6-4

  o snow.sim now has a C code back-end.

  o parameterSets (used by fitBySampling etc) now generates a regular
    sequence along each parameter range, rather than using quantile().

Changes in Version 0.6-3

  o new SMA "snow" -- and function snow.sim() -- from Jarkko Koskela.

  o SMA "runoffratio" now has threshold and mass balance parameters.

  o class of hydromad objects is now c("hydromad.<sma>", "hydromad").

  o the 'fixed.ar' argument to armax.sriv.fit now works
    (and this is used by expuh rfit methods too).

  o hydromad.options("prefilter") now has 3 hard-coded prefilters.
    The 'prefilter' argument is now allowed to be a prefilter-generating
    function (function(DATA)).

  o more information about fit results is printed.

Changes in Version 0.6-2

  o armax.sriv.fit() now takes an argument fallback (default TRUE),
    to return the current best result if the matrix cannot be solved.

  o predict(return_components = TRUE) didn't work.

Changes in Version 0.6-1

  o armax.sim() (and therefore predict()) takes return_components argument.

  o new simple SMA "runoffratio" - and function runoffratio.sim().
    (it scales P by observed flow, so can not be used for prediction).

  o coef() can now be assigned to.

  o update(model, sma = ...) changes the SMA and resets its parameters.

  o changed default hydromad.options("inverse.rel.tolerance") to 1/1000.

Changes in Version 0.6-0

  o "uh" routing renamed to "armax".

  o new "lambda" routing option.

  o better simulation of third order transfer function models.

  o unit tests for transfer functions.

Changes in Version 0.5-4

  o event.clusters() renamed to eventseq()

  o functions getU() and getP() removed;
    use fitted(U = TRUE) and observed(item = "P").
