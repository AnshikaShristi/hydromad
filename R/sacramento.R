#' Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model.
#' Developed by the US National Weather Service.
#'
#' This description of the model is given by Burnash (1995):
#'
#' \dQuote{The moisture accounting system utilized in the Sacramento
#' Catchment Model is a carefully structured representation of the
#' catchment's soil moisture storage system. It is based on using
#' simple approximations of many of those soil moisture processes
#' which have been reported in the hydrologic literature. The authors
#' have organised these approximations in a manner which would allow
#' the determination of many catchment characteristics from carefully
#' selected portions of the catchment's hydrologic record. Inasmuch as
#' many of the catchment characteristics are related to the soil
#' moisture capabilities of the catchment, an intelligent application
#' of the model start with a good understanding of the three basic
#' types of soil moisture which can potentially influence catchment
#' runoff conditions. These soil moisture types are: (1) Hygroscopic
#' Water, (2) Tension Water and (3) Free Water. } 
#'
#' [...]
#'
#' \dQuote{Streamflow as computed by the Sacramento Catchment Model is
#' the result of processing precipiatation through an algorithm
#' representing the uppermost soil mantle identified as the upper zone
#' and a deeper portion of the soil mantle or lower zone. The
#' algorithm computes runoff in five basic forms. These are (1) direct
#' runoff from permanant and temporary impervious areas, (2) surface
#' runoff due to precipitation occurring at a rate faster than
#' percolation and interflow can take place when both upper zone
#' storages are full, (3) interflow resulting from the lateral
#' drainage of a temporary free water storage, (4) supplemental base
#' flow, and (5) primary base flow.} (Burnash, 1995)

#' @param DATA time-series-like object with columns P (precipitation,
#'   mm) and (potential evapo-transpiration, mm). 
#' @param uztwm Upper zone tension water maximum capacity (mm).
#' @param uzfwm Upper zone free water maximum capacity (mm).
#' @param uzk Lateral drainage rate of upper zone free water expressed
#'   as a fraction of contents per day. 
#' @param pctim The fraction of the catchment which produces
#'   impervious runoff during low flow conditions. 
#' @param adimp The additional fraction of the catchment which
#'   exhibits impervious characteristics when the catchment's tension
#'   water requirements are met. 
#' @param zperc Maximum percolation (from upper zone free water into
#'   the lower zone) rate coefficient. 
#' @param rexp An exponent determining the rate of change of the
#'   percolation rate with changing lower zone water contents. 
#' @param lztwm Lower zone tension water maximum capacity (mm).
#' @param lzfsm Lower zone supplemental free water maximum capacity (mm).
#' @param lzfpm Lower zone primary free water maximum capacity (mm).
#' @param lzsk Lateral drainage rate of lower zone supplemental free
#'   water expressed as a fraction of contents per day. 
#' @param lzpk Lateral drainage rate of lower zone primary free water
#'   expressed as a fraction of contents per day. 
#' @param pfree Direct percolation fraction from upper to lower zone
#'   free water (the percentage of percolated water which is available
#'   to the lower zone free water aquifers before all lower zone tension
#'   water deficiencies are satisfied). 
#' @param etmult Multiplier applied to \code{DATA$E} to estimate
#'   potential evapotranspiration. 
#' @param dt Length of each time step in days.
#' @param return_state Not currently supported.
#' @return the simulated effective rainfall (\dQuote{total channel
#'   inflow}), a time series of the same length as the input series.
