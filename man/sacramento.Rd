\details{
  This description of the model is given by Burnash (1995):

  \dQuote{The moisture accounting system utilized in the Sacramento
    Catchment Model is a carefully structured representation of the
    catchment's soil moisture storage system. It is based on using
    simple approximations of many of those soil moisture processes
    which have been reported in the hydrologic literature. The authors
    have organised these approximations in a manner which would allow
    the determination of many catchment characteristics from carefully
    selected portions of the catchment's hydrologic record. Inasmuch as
    many of the catchment characteristics are related to the soil
    moisture capabilities of the catchment, an intelligent application
    of the model start with a good understanding of the three basic
    types of soil moisture which can potentially influence catchment
    runoff conditions. These soil moisture types are: (1) Hygroscopic
    Water, (2) Tension Water and (3) Free Water. }

  [...]

  \dQuote{Streamflow as computed by the Sacramento Catchment Model is
    the result of processing precipiatation through an algorithm
    representing the uppermost soil mantle identified as the upper zone
    and a deeper portion of the soil mantle or lower zone. The
    algorithm computes runoff in five basic forms. These are (1) direct
    runoff from permanant and temporary impervious areas, (2) surface
    runoff due to precipitation occurring at a rate faster than
    percolation and interflow can take place when both upper zone
    storages are full, (3) interflow resulting from the lateral
    drainage of a temporary free water storage, (4) supplemental base
    flow, and (5) primary base flow.} (Burnash, 1995)

  The default parameter ranges were taken from Blasone et. al. (2008).
