\section{The IHACRES framework}

Models defined in the \ihacres{} framework estimate streamflow at a
catchment outlet, given inputs of areal rainfall and potential
evaporation or, more commonly, temperature data as an indicator of this.
These inputs and outputs are time series, typically at a daily
time step, and extending for many months or years.

The \ihacres{} framework defines a two-component
structure:
(1) a \emph{soil moisture accounting} (SMA) module; and
(2) a \emph{routing} or \emph{unit hydrograph} module
 (Figure \ref{fig:ihacres-framework}).
The SMA module converts rainfall and temperature into \emph{effective
  rainfall} --- the amount of rainfall which eventually reaches the
catchment outlet as streamflow (i.e. that which is not lost as evaporation etc). The
routing module converts effective rainfall into streamflow, which
amounts to defining the peak response and shape of the recession curve.
It is usually a linear transfer function, which can be as simple as a
single exponential recession (i.e. constant decay rate), although
variants with non-linearities are also available.

There are two published effective rainfall (loss) modules that are
often associated with the \ihacres{} framework, referred to
here as CWI (Catchment Wetness Index) and CMD (Catchment
Moisture Deficit), and are described in sections \ref{sec:cwi} and
\ref{sec:cmd}. However, many other models are consistent with the
framework, and implementations of some of these are included in the
\pkg{hydromad} package. 



\section{The CWI effective rainfall model}
\label{sec:cwi}

The first effective rainfall model for \ihacres{} incorporated an
antecedent precipitation index and was introduced by
\citet{JakemanEtAl:1990}, based on the Bedford-Ouse model of
\citet{WhiteheadEtAl:1979}. A slightly more physics-based version
based on a Catchment Wetness Index (CWI) was developed in
\citet{JakemanHornberger:1993}. It is also known as the \emph{classic}
\ihacres{} model. The version implemented here incorporates the
extensions for ephemeral catchments of \citet{YeEtAl:1997}; this has
also been slightly reformulated to make calibration easier (EMS
Software note...).  It is a metric-type model, as described by
\citet{KokkonenJakeman:2001}.  Rainfall runoff is proportional to a
soil moisture index, which is defined by an exponential smoothing of
rainfall, and the output is scaled to enforce mass balance.

\subsection{Definition}

The effective rainfall $U$ at each time step is proportional to
rainfall $P$ and a soil moisture index $s$:
\begin{equation}
U_t = c \cdot s_t \cdot P_t
\end{equation}

Two extra parameters $l$ and $p$ can be used for ephemeral rivers.
\code{l} is a moisture threshold for producing flow, and \code{p} is a
power transformation for the soil moisture index. In this case:
\begin{equation}
U_t = (c (s_t - l))^p \cdot P_t \qquad (U_t \geq 0)
\end{equation}

The soil moisture index $s$ is calculated by a filter applied to the rainfall,
where the \emph{drying rate} is referred to as $1 / \tau_{\omega,t}$:
\begin{equation}
s_t = (1 - 1 / \tau_{\omega,t}) s_{t-1} + P_t \qquad (s_t \geq 0)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Drying rate}

The drying rate $1 / \tau_{\omega,t}$ is the proportion of soil
moisture that is lost in a time step $t$.
If the drying rate is constant, this approximates an exponential smoothing
process. In this case the parameter $f$ is zero, and the drying rate
is given by the parameter $\tau_\omega$ (\code{tw}):
\begin{equation}
\tau_{\omega,t} = \tau_\omega
\end{equation}

Otherwise the drying rate depends on the input data \code{E}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:drying-rate}
\tau_{\omega,t} = \tau_\omega \exp\left(-0.062 f (E_t - T_{\mathrm{ref}})\right)
\end{equation}

Note that $E_t$ in Equation \ref{eq:drying-rate} has
a \emph{reference temperature} $T_{\mathrm{ref}}$ (\code{t\_ref}) subtracted from
it\footnote{\code{t\_ref} is not a parameter; changing it is equivalent
 to transforming \code{tw}}. This defaults to a value of
20, but it is recommended to set it to 3 when using potential
evaporation data as \code{E}.

The parameter $\tau_\omega$ (\code{tw}) defines the \emph{drying rate at the
reference temperature}, while parameter $f$ defines the degree of
\emph{temperature dependence of the drying rate}.
The effect of these parameters is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cwi-drying-rate}.

\section{The CMD effective rainfall model}
\label{sec:cmd}

The Catchment Moisture Deficit (CMD) effective rainfall model for
\ihacres{} was introduced by \citet{EvansJakeman:1998} and
substantially revised by \citet{CrokeJakeman:2004}. It is a
conceptual-type model, as described by
\citet{KokkonenJakeman:2001}. Rainfall is partitioned explicitly into
drainage, evapo-transpiration, and changes in catchment moisture storage.

\subsection{Definition}

Catchment Moisture Deficit $M$ represents the dryness of a catchment,
in terms of the volume of water needed to reach a \emph{saturation} level
(at $M=0$). It is given in the same units as rainfall per timestep,
typically mm.

The mass balance step is:
\begin{equation}
M[t] = M[t-1] - P[t] + E_T[t] + U[t]
\end{equation}

where $M$ represents catchment moisture deficit,
constrained below by 0,
P is catchment areal rainfall, $E_T$ is evapo-transpiration, and
U is drainage (effective rainfall).

Rainfall effectiveness (i.e. proportion of rain that drains to the stream) is
a simple \emph{instantaneous} function of the CMD, with a threshold at $M
= d$. For this reason \code{d} can be called the \emph{CMD threshold for
  producing flow}.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dUdP}
\frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d}P} = 1 - \min(1, M/d)
\end{equation}

The actual drainage from rainfall input each time step involves the integral of Equation \ref{eq:dUdP};
see \citet{CrokeJakeman:2004}.
%The actual drainage is calculated according to the function:

<<cmd-drainage-fun, echo=FALSE, results=hide>>=
drainage <- function(M, P, d) {
    extraP <- P - max(0, M - d)
    if (extraP <= 0) {
        Mf <- M - P
        U <- 0
    } else {
        Mf <- min(M, d) * exp(-extraP / d)
        U <- P - (M - Mf)
    }
    U/P
}
@

<<cmd-drainage-fun2, echo=FALSE, results=hide>>=
drainage2 <- function(M, P, d) {
	Mf <- if (M < d) M * exp(-P / d)
		else if (M < d+P) d * exp((-P+M-d)/d)
		else M - P
	dM <- Mf - M
	U <- P - (-dM)
	U/P
}
@

\begin{figure}[hbpt]
\begin{center}
\setkeys{Gin}{width=5.5in}
<<cmd-drainage, fig=TRUE, width=5.5, height=2.5>>=
dU_dP <- function(M, d) 1 - min(1, M/d)

                    d = seq(50, 400, length = 3))
cmdu$U_P <- with(cmdu, mapply(drainage, M=M, d=d, P=100))
cmdu$dU_dP <- with(cmdu, mapply(dU_dP, M=M, d=d))
foo <- xyplot(dU_dP + U_P ~ M | factor(d), data = cmdu, type = "l",

	par.settings = list(superpose.line = list(lwd = 2)),
	auto.key = list(text = expression(dU / dP, (U / P)[P==100]),

  The line marked $dU/dP$ is the instantaneous rate of runoff;
  whereas $(U/P)_{P=100}$ is the actual runoff proportion from 100mm of rainfall.
}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Evapo-transpiration (as a proportion of the potential rate, \code{E[t]})
is also a simple function of the CMD, with a threshold at $M = f
d$. Parameter $f$ is known as the \emph{stress threshold}\footnote{This $f$ is not to be confused with the
  unrelated parameter $f$ in the CWI model.}. It is
given as a proportion of the \emph{flow threshold} \code{d}, in order
to reduce covariance of these parameters. Parameter
\code{e} simply scales the result, and is known as the
\emph{temperature to PET conversion factor}.
\begin{equation}
E_T[t] = e E[t] \min(1, \exp\left(2\left(1 - \frac{M_f}{fd}\right)\right))
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[hbpt]
\begin{center}
\setkeys{Gin}{width=4.8in}
<<cmd-evap, fig=TRUE, width=4.8, height=2.5>>=
evap <- function(M, f, d=400) {
	g <- f * d
	min(1, exp(2 * (1 - M/g)))
}
cmde <- expand.grid(M = seq(0, 500, by = 5),
                    f = seq(0.1, 0.5, by = 0.2))
cmde$evap <- with(cmde, mapply(evap, M = M, f = f))
foo <- xyplot(evap ~ M | factor(f), data = cmde, type = "l", lwd = 2,
        strip = strip.custom(var.name = "f", sep=" = ", strip.names = TRUE),
        as.table = TRUE, aspect = 1,
	ylab="evaporation as fraction\n of potential (ET / PET)",
	xlab="CMD (catchment moisture deficit) state, mm")
print(foo)

  showing effect of parameter \code{f}.
  Here the threshold parameter \code{d} is fixed at 400.
}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Note that the evapo-transpiration calculation is based on $M_f$,
which is the CMD \emph{after} precipitation and drainage have been
accounted for (as in the \code{drainage} function above).


\section{The Unit Hydrograph model}

The Unit Hydrograph routing module converts a time series of effective
rainfall into streamflow. As such it affects the size of flow peaks
and the duration of flow after a peak.

The standard unit hydrograph is a \emph{transfer function}, with input
$U$ and output $Q$. In statistical terminology this is called an ARMAX
model, for \emph{Auto-Regressive Moving Average with eXogenous input}
\citep{Ljung:1999}.
\begin{equation}
Q[t] = a_1 Q[t-1] + \ldots + a_n Q[t-n] +
       b_0 U[t-\delta] + \ldots + b_m U[t-m-\delta]
\end{equation}
The \emph{order} is denoted $(n, m)$, with delay $\delta$. The
number of parameters is $n + m + 1$.

In hydrology it is natural to decompose the transfer function into a
system of exponentially receding components, which may be in a
parallel and/or series configuration. Each component is defined by a
recession rate $\alpha$ and peak response $\beta$, or equivalently, a
time constant $\tau$ and fractional volume $v$. In this form the
parameters are physically interpretable. For further discussion, see
for example \citet{Young:2003}. 

f there are two components in parallel, which we call quick $Q_q$ and slow $Q_s$, then
$Q[t] = Q_q[t] + Q_s[t]$, and:
\begin{align}
Q_q[t] &= \alpha_q Q_q[t-1] + \beta_q U[t] \nonumber \\
Q_s[t] &= \alpha_s Q_s[t-1] + \beta_s U[t]
\end{align}

It is often easier to define these exponential components in terms of
time constants $\tau$ (number of time steps to reduce to a fraction
$1/e \approx 37\%$) and fractional volumes $v$:
\begin{align}
\tau &= -1 / \log(\alpha) \\
v &= \beta / (1 - \alpha)
\end{align}

Generally it is assumed that the total volume (\emph{steady state gain}) is 1. 

Functions in this package allow the model to be specified in
either $\{\tau, v\}$ form, or $\{a, b\}$ form. In the former, several
model structures are possible:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{(tau\_s=)}, a single exponential store.
\item \code{(v\_s=)}, a single instantaneous response.
\item \code{(tau\_s=, v\_s=)}, exponential store and instantaneous response in parallel.
  The instantaneous store has volume $v_q = 1 - v_s$.
\item \code{(tau\_s=, tau\_q=, v\_s=)}, two exponential stores in parallel.
\item \code{(tau\_s=, tau\_q=, v\_s=, series=1)}, two exponential stores in series.
\item \code{(tau\_s=, tau\_q=, v\_s=, v\_3=)}, two exponential stores and an instantaneous component in parallel.
  Here $v_q = 1 - v_s - v_3$ and $\tau_3 = 0$.
\item \code{(tau\_s=, tau\_q=, tau\_3=, v\_s=, v\_3=)}, three stores in parallel.
\item \code{(tau\_s=, tau\_q=, tau\_3=, v\_s=, v\_3=, series=1)}, two
  stores in series and one in parallel (S * 3 in parallel; + Q in series).
\item \code{(tau\_s=, tau\_q=, tau\_3=, v\_s=, v\_3=, series=2)}, two
  stores in parallel and one in series (S + Q in parallel; * 3 in series).
\item \code{(tau\_s=, tau\_q=, tau\_3=, v\_s=, v\_3=, series=3)}, three stores in series.
\end{itemize}

Alternatively, models can be specified in $\{a, b\}$ form, like
\code{(a\_1=, a\_2=, a\_3=, b\_0=, b\_1=, b\_2=, b\_3=)}.


\subsection{Lambda Unit Hydrograph model}

An extension of the basic unit hydrograph model is also
available. Known as the \emph{lambda} form, this allows the
partitioning of flow between quick and slow components to depend on
the magnitude of effective rainfall. In this model, runoff from large
rainfall events tends to be quick flow, and runoff from small events
tends to be slow flow:

\begin{align}
  v_s[t] &= v_{s,0} U[t] ^ \lambda \qquad \text{ where } 0 \leq v_s \leq 1 \\
  v_q[t] &= 1 - v_s[t] \nonumber
\end{align}

The \code{lambda} ($\lambda$) parameter may take values between -1 and
0, where a value of 0 corresponds to the basic model.


\subsection{Unit Hydrograph loss parameter}

To simulate loss of baseflow (e.g. infiltration to groundwater), a
constant loss rate can be specified from the slow flow component
\citep{IvkovicEtAl:2009}. If we
assume a bucket model representing the slow flow store $G$ as:

\begin{align}
  G[t] &= G[t-1] - Q_s[t] + v_s U[t] - L[t] \\
  Q_s[t] &= a G[t]
\end{align}

Defining $a = (1 / \alpha_s - 1)$ this is equivalent to a constant
term in the original model:

\begin{align}
  Q_s[t] &= Q_s[t-1] + \beta_s U[t] - (1 - \alpha_s) L[t]
\end{align}

and $L$ can be given as parameter \code{loss}.
