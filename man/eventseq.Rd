\usage{
eventseq(x, thresh = 0, mingap = 1, mindur = 1,
         stopthresh = thresh, stopx = x,
         below = FALSE, all = FALSE, n = NA)

eventapply(X, events, FUN = sum, ...,
           by.column = TRUE, simplify = TRUE,
           TIMING = c("start", "middle", "end"))

}
\arguments{
  \item{x, X}{
    a \code{\link{ts}} or \code{\link{zoo}} object.
    May be multivariate, i.e. have multiple columns.
    In this case, events are defined jointly over the multiple
    time series: events continue while any series exceeds the
    threshold (or remains below the threshold if \code{below = TRUE}. 
  }
  \item{thresh}{
    threshold value: the data must be strictly above this level (or, if
    \code{below = TRUE}, below this level) to define an event. 
  }
  \item{mingap}{
    the minimum number of time steps that can separate events. Any
    inter-event durations shorter than this will be subsumed into the
    surrounding event.
  }
  \item{mindur}{
    the minimum number of time steps in each event window. Any
    events whose duration is shorter than this will be extended.
  }
  \item{stopthresh}{
    \code{stopthresh} gives a second threshold value to define when
    events stop: after an event is initiated by exceeding \code{thresh},
    it must then drop below \code{stopthresh} to terminate the event.
  }
  \item{stopx}{
    optionally, a different series may be given to determine event
    termination with \code{stopthresh}. E.g. an input series may define
    event starts and a response series may define when they end.
  }
  \item{below}{
    to identify events where the data falls below \code{thresh} (and/or
    \code{stopthresh}). Setting this to \code{TRUE} is equivalent to
    negating \code{x}, \code{thresh}, etc.
  }
  \item{all}{
    to include the periods between events as additional levels (i.e. as
    events in themselves). These inter-events will be assigned negative
    levels, while the actual events will have positive levels. Otherwise
    -- in the default case -- these inter-event periods are left as
    \code{NA}. 
  }
  \item{n}{
    number of events to be identified: if this is given, then a value of
    \code{thresh} is automatically chosen such that about this many
    events are returned. A warning is given if the actual number of
    events is not within 5 percent of \code{n}. 
  }
  \item{events}{
    a \code{factor}-like object, perhaps \code{\link{ts}} or
    \code{\link{zoo}}. Its levels (unique values) define events, and
    \code{NA} values are ignored. If \code{events} is a factor or
    vector, its values are assumed to correspond to \code{X}; otherwise,
    it is assumed to be a time series object and is merged
    (\code{cbind}ed) with \code{X}.
  }
  \item{FUN, \dots, by.column}{
    a function to apply to the values in each event. In the default case
    of \code{by.column = TRUE}, \code{FUN} will be passed a vector of
    values from one column of \code{X}. When \code{by.column = FALSE},
    which only makes sense when \code{X} is a matrix, \code{FUN} will be
    passed a matrix. The dots (\code{\dots}) are passed on too.
  }
  \item{simplify}{
    if \code{FALSE}, the result will be returned as a list with one
    (named) element for each event, rather than a time series like
    object. This case allows \code{FUN} to return a complex object or
    vectors of variable lengths.
  }
  \item{TIMING}{
    defines how to construct the time index of the result. Should the
    time corresponding to an event be taken from the \code{time()} of
    its start, middle, or end?
  }
}
\value{
  
  \code{eventseq} returns a zoo object, with core data consisting of an
  ordered \code{\link{factor}}, representing the identified events, and
  the same time index as \code{x}. Periods between events are left as
  \code{NA}, unless \code{all = TRUE} in which case they are treated as
  separate events.

  \code{eventapply} returns a \code{zoo} object (an irregular time
  series in this case), with the value returned from \code{FUN}
  applied to each discrete event in \code{X}.

  \code{eventinfo} returns a \code{data.frame} with columns
  \describe{
    \item{\code{Time}}{
      time that the event started (from \code{time(X)}).
    }
    \item{\code{Month, Year}}{
      month and year (as integers) of the mid-point of the event.
    }
    \item{\code{Value}}{
      result of \code{FUN} applied to the event.
    }
    \item{\code{Duration}}{
      length of the event in time steps / data points.
    }
    \item{\code{PreDuration}}{
      number of time steps since the last event ended.
    }
  }
