\title{ IHACRES Catchment Moisture Deficit (CMD) model }
\description{
  The Catchment Moisture Deficit (CMD) effective rainfall model for IHACRES.
  It is a conceptual-type model, where input rainfall is partitioned explicitly into
  drainage, evapo-transpiration, and changes in catchment moisture.
}
\usage{
cmd.sim(DATA, d, f, e, M_0 = d/2,
        return_state = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{DATA}{
    a \code{\link{ts}}-like object with named components:
    \describe{
      \item{\code{P}}{ time series of areal rainfall depths, usually in mm. }
      \item{\code{E}}{ time series of potential evapo-transpiration, or more typically,
	temperature as an indicator of this. }
    }
  }
  \item{d}{ CMD threshold for producing flow. }
  \item{f}{ CMD stress threshold as a proportion of \code{d}. }
  \item{e}{ temperature to PET conversion factor. }
  \item{M_0}{ starting CMD value. }
  \item{return_state}{ to return state variables as well as the effective rainfall. }
}
\details{
	The mass balance step is:
	\deqn{M[t] = M[t-1] - P[t] + E_T[t] + U[t]}

	where \eqn{M} represents catchment moisture deficit (CMD),
	constrained below by 0 (the nominal fully saturated level).
	P is catchment areal rainfall, \eqn{E_T} is evapo-transpiration, and
	U is drainage (effective rainfall). All are, typically, in units of
	mm per time step.

	Rainfall effectiveness (i.e. drainage proportion) is
	a simple \emph{instantaneous} function of the CMD, with a threshold at \eqn{M = d}:
	\deqn{\frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d}P} = 1 - \min(1, M/d)}{
	      dU/dP = 1 - min(1, M/d)}

	The actual drainage each time step involves the integral of that relation.

	Evapo-transpiration (as a proportion of the potential rate, \code{E[t]})
	is also a simple function of the CMD, with a threshold at \eqn{M = f d}{M = f * d}:
	\deqn{E_T[t] = e E[t] \min(1, \exp\left(2\left(1 - \frac{M_f}{fd}\right)\right))}{
	      E_T[t] = e E[t] \min(1, \exp(2(1 - M_f / (fd))))}

        Note that the evapo-transpiration calculation is based on \eqn{M_f},
	which is the CMD after precipitation and drainage have been accounted for.
}
\value{
  \code{cmd.sim} returns the modelled time series of effective rainfall,
  or if \code{return_state = TRUE}, a multi-variate time series with named
  columns \code{U} (effective rainfall), \code{CMD} and
  \code{ET} (evapo-transpiration \eqn{E_T}).
}
\note{
  Normally compiled C code is used for simulation, but if
  \code{return_state = TRUE} a slower implementation in R is used.
