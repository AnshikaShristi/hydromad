Description: Spatially-lumped models and tools for environmental hydrology.
  A modelling framework for water balance accounting and flow routing.
  Simulation, estimation, assessment and visualisation 
  of catchment response to time series of rainfall and other drivers.
  Includes IHACRES models (CWI, CMD), transfer function  estimators
  (including SRIV - Simplified Refined Instrumental Variable), etc.
